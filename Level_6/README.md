## Braces
### Braces.hpp
Write a function that takes a string of braces, and determines if the order of the braces is valid.<br> 
It should return true if the string is valid, and false if it's invalid.<br>
<br>
This Kata is similar to the Valid Parentheses Kata, but introduces new characters: brackets [], and curly braces {}.<br> 
Thanks to @arnedag for the idea!<br>
<br>
All input strings will be nonempty, and will only consist of parentheses, brackets and curly braces: ()[]{}.<br>
<br>
What is considered Valid?<br>
A string of braces is considered valid if all braces are matched with the correct brace.<br>
<br>
Examples<br>
"(){}[]"   =>  True<br>
"([{}])"   =>  True<br>
"(}"       =>  False<br>
"[(])"     =>  False<br>
"[({})](]" =>  False<br>



## statistics
### stat.hpp
You are the "computer expert" of a local Athletic Association (C.A.A.). Many teams of runners come to compete. <br>
Each time you get a string of all race results of every team who has run. <br>
For example here is a string showing the individual results of a team of 5 runners:<br>
<br>
"01|15|59, 1|47|6, 01|17|20, 1|32|34, 2|3|17"<br>
<br>
Each part of the string is of the form: h|m|s where h, m, s (h for hour, m for minutes, s for seconds) are positive or null<br> integer (represented as strings) with one or two digits. There are no traps in this format.<br>
<br>
To compare the results of the teams you are asked for giving three statistics; range, average and median.<br>
<br>
Range : difference between the lowest and highest values. In {4, 6, 9, 3, 7} the lowest value is 3, and the highest is 9, so the range is 9 âˆ’ 3 = 6.<br>
<br>
Mean or Average : To calculate mean, add together all of the numbers in a set and then divide the sum by the total count of numbers.<br>
<br>
Median : In statistics, the median is the number separating the higher half of a data sample from the lower half. The median of a finite list of numbers can be found by arranging all the observations from lowest value to highest value and picking the middle one (e.g., the median of {3, 3, 5, 9, 11} is 5) when there is an odd number of observations. If there is an even number of observations, then there is no single middle value; the median is then defined to be the mean of the two middle values (the median of {3, 5, 6, 9} is (5 + 6) / 2 = 5.5).<br>
<br>
Your task is to return a string giving these 3 values. For the example given above, the string result will be
<br>
"Range: 00|47|18 Average: 01|35|15 Median: 01|32|34"
<br>
of the form:<br>

"Range: hh|mm|ss Average: hh|mm|ss Median: hh|mm|ss"<br>
<br>
where hh, mm, ss are integers (represented by strings) with each 2 digits.<br>
<br>
Remarks:<br>
<br>
if a result in seconds is ab.xy... it will be given truncated as ab.<br>
<br>
if the given string is "" you will return ""


## Rainfall
### rainfall.hpp
data and data1 are two strings with rainfall records of a few cities for months from January to December. The records of towns are separated by \n. The name of each town is followed by :.<br>
<br>
data and towns can be seen in "Your Test Cases:".<br>
<br>
Task:<br>
function: mean(town, strng) should return the average of rainfall for the city town and the strng data or data1 (In R and Julia this function is called avg).<br>
function: variance(town, strng) should return the variance of rainfall for the city town and the strng data or data1.
Examples:<br>
mean("London", data), 51.19(9999999999996) <br>
variance("London", data), 57.42(833333333374)<br>
Notes:<br>
if functions mean or variance have as parameter town a city which has no records return -1 or -1.0 (depending on the language)
Don't truncate or round: the tests will pass if abs(your_result - test_result) <= 1e-2 or abs((your_result - test_result) / test_result) <= 1e-6 depending on the language.<br>
Shell tests only variance<br>

## Find the odd int
### oddInt.hpp
Given an array, find the int that appears an odd number of times.<br>
There will always be only one integer that appears an odd number of times.<br>


## Are they the "same"?<br>
## theSame.hpp<br>
Given two arrays a and b write a function comp(a, b) (compSame(a, b) in Clojure) that checks whether the two arrays have the "same" elements, with the same multiplicities. "Same" means, here, that the elements in b are the elements in a squared, regardless of the order.<br>
<br>
Examples<br>
Valid arrays<br>
a = [121, 144, 19, 161, 19, 144, 19, 11]  <br>
b = [121, 14641, 20736, 361, 25921, 361, 20736, 361]<br>
comp(a, b) returns true because in b 121 is the square of 11, 14641 is the square of 121, 20736 the square of 144, 361 the square of 19, 25921 the square of 161, and so on. It gets obvious if we write b's elements in terms of squares:<br>
<br>
a = [121, 144, 19, 161, 19, 144, 19, 11] <br>
b = [11*11, 121*121, 144*144, 19*19, 161*161, 19*19, 144*144, 19*19]<br>
Invalid arrays<br>
If we change the first number to something else, comp may not return true anymore:<br>
<br>
a = [121, 144, 19, 161, 19, 144, 19, 11]  <br>
b = [132, 14641, 20736, 361, 25921, 361, 20736, 361]<br>
comp(a,b) returns false because in b 132 is not the square of any number of a.
<br>
a = [121, 144, 19, 161, 19, 144, 19, 11]  <br>
b = [121, 14641, 20736, 36100, 25921, 361, 20736, 361]<br>
comp(a,b) returns false because in b 36100 is not the square of any number of a.
<br>
Remarks<br>
a or b might be [] (all languages except R, Shell). a or b might be nil or null or None or nothing (except in Haskell, Elixir, C++, Rust, R, Shell, PureScript).<br>
<br>
If a or b are nil (or null or None), the problem doesn't make sense so return false.<br>
If a or b are empty then the result is self-evident.<br>
a or b are empty or not empty lists.<br>







## Roman Numerals Decoder<br>
## RomanNumerals.hpp<br>
Create a function that takes a Roman numeral as its argument and returns its value as a numeric decimal integer. You don't need to validate the form of the Roman numeral.<br>
Modern Roman numerals are written by expressing each decimal digit of the number to be encoded separately, starting with the leftmost digit and skipping any 0s. So 1990 is rendered "MCMXC" (1000 = M, 900 = CM, 90 = XC) and 2008 is rendered "MMVIII" (2000 = MM, 8 = VIII). The Roman numeral for 1666, "MDCLXVI", uses each letter in descending order.<br>
<br>
Example:<br>
<br>
solution("XXI"); // => 21<br>
Help:<br>
<br>
Symbol    Value<br>
I          1<br>
V          5<br>
X          10<br>
L          50<br>
C          100<br>
D          500<br>
M          1,000<br>
